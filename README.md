## Background Removal with rembg | Just For Fun ü§ó

This repository contains a Python script for removing backgrounds from images using the `rembg` library. It provides a simple solution for automatically removing backgrounds from a collection of images.

### Installation

Before running the script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required Python modules using pip:

```bash
pip install rembg pillow
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

2. Place your images in the `inputs` directory. These should be JPG files with the backgrounds you want to remove.

3. Run the Python script `remove_background.py`:

```bash
python remove_background.py
```

4. After the script finishes executing, the images with removed backgrounds will be saved in the `no-background` directory as PNG files.

### Example

Suppose you have a collection of images named `banana.jpg`, `berries.jpg`, `empty-globe.jpg`, and `icecream-cone.jpg` in the `inputs` directory. Running the script will remove the backgrounds from these images and save the resulting images in the `no-background` directory.

### Notes

- Make sure to adjust the file paths in the script if your directory structure differs.
- The `rembg` library utilizes AI-based algorithms for background removal, providing accurate results.
- Feel free to modify the script or integrate it into your projects as needed.
